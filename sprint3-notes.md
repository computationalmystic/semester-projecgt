# First Draft RJI Group Overview

First of all, the progress all of the teams have made is outstanding. Across the board! My notes below may seem critical, but that is because we are learning how to do "new things" in our work as teams, and its not always clear what a "well written issue should be", and many teams did not quite land on the "developer instructions" mark. But that's ok! We have sprint 4!

## General Items Across RJI Projects
1. More clearly defined issues will help a lot of people. 
2. Many of the readme.md's are good
3. Some of the developer instructions need work. Here are two examples from Augur, which are not perfect, but they give you a clearer idea what those instructions look like: http://augur.augurlabs.io/static/docs/dev-guide/2-install.html and sometimes they become part of the "README": https://github.com/chaoss/augur/blob/master/README.md 
4. Put the sample site in your readme.md file as well. 

## Each RJI Group's Notes

1. RJI Group 1 Issue: 
	- Site: https://rjimizzou.info/
    - Issues are succinct and clear. 
    - Team communication through issues is good. 
    - Explanation of machine learning is good. 
1. RJI Group 4 Issue: https://github.com/MJC598/RJI-Software-Engineering-Project/issues/10
	- Site: http://ec2-3-19-26-62.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/
    - Good read me. 
    - Issues descriptions are above average. 
    - Machine learning explanation is good. Read me is coming along.
    - Developer instructions need to be stronger 
1. RJI Group 11 Issue: https://github.com/AlDavis612/Group11SoftwareProject/issues/9
	- Site: ec2-3-91-221-41.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    - Issue descriptions are sparse and not clear enough for a developer.
    - Developer instructions are quite strong 
1. RJI Group 14 Issue: (this is my issue) https://github.com/TheForgottenTime/RJI-group14/issues/15
    - Site: http://ec2-18-216-214-86.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/ 
    - Issue descriptions need to be stronger. 
    - Developer instructions are for a developer. Your document, like others, refers the user to a deployment environment.
1. RJI Group 15 Issue: (Not stellar structure, but clear and understandable): https://github.com/mas2g2/RJI-CS4320-Project/issues/12
    - Good Reference to an external issue: https://github.com/idealo/image-quality-assessment/issues/20
    - Thorough "README": https://github.com/mas2g2/RJI-CS4320-Project
    - Site: http://3.14.73.158/login
    - Site rated two photos at once. Nice! 
    - Issue creation and commenting is very active! Nice!
    - Excellent and clear developer instructions. 
1. RJI Group 17: Issue: https://github.com/WestonV/RJI-Image-Classifier/issues/9
    - You need deployment instructions for a developer. Not just a link to the site. 
    - Site: http://ec2-52-23-195-32.compute-1.amazonaws.com/
    - Does upload some smaller pix, but does not show a rating
1. RJI Group 20: Issue: This issue is ok, but issues all need more activity: https://github.com/pskggc/Group-20-Software-Engineering/issues/6
    - Site seems down
    - The instructions are quite thorough for an end user!  Good job... but developers need instructions on how to install and run the various parts of your system!
1. RJI Group 23: Issue: https://github.com/computationalmystic/RJI-group23/issues/12
    - Site seems down. Cannot find a link 
    - Read me could use a little more elaboration. 
    - The development installation instructions are pretty light. Look at Augur's. You don't have that much to describe, but you need to make it more clear what a person will do to install your system. 
1. RJI Group 24: Issue: https://github.com/computationalmystic/RJI-group24/issues/7
    - Site: http://ec2-18-222-50-172.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/SoftwareDev/login.php
    - Is your classification connected yet in deployment? 
    - Your developer instructions need to be more than a link to how to use the site. They are for another developer to install. 
1. RJI Group 27 Issue: https://github.com/bradywebb8/Group27-RJI/issues/1
    - Not much discussion on issues, and they could be more clear
    - Developer instructions need to be a little more complete. 
    - Could not find a link to the live site.
